# BellaBeat-Case-Study

#### ***[Data Source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit)***

## **Introduction**
In this Case Study, I am a hypothetical Junior Analyst at a company called ***BellaBeat***. BellaBeat is a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. The Chief Creative Officer, Urška Sršen, believes that new growth opportunities for the company can come from analyzing device fitness data. My job in this case study will be to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices.

## **Ask**
### ***Identify the business task***
The business task in this study will be to analyze smart device usage to gain insight on how consumers use non-BellaBeat smart devices. Using that analysis, I will come up with recommendations for how this information can help BellaBeat marketing strategies.

### ***Identify Stakeholders***
The stakeholders will be 
* Urška Sršen: Bellabeat’s cofounder and Chief Creative Officer
* Sando Mur: Mathematician and Bellabeat’s cofounder; key member of the Bellabeat executive team
* Bellabeat marketing analytics team

## **Prepare**
### ***Download data and store it appropriately***
[FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through ([Mobius](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic)): This Kaggle data set contains personal fitness tracker from thirty fitbit users. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits.

### ***Organization and Credibility***
The dataset has 18 seperate CSV (Comma Seperated Value) files. The datasets contain information from thirty fitbit users who gave permission to track a variety of things including steps, heart rate, etc. The data dates from March, to May of 2016 so it is slightly outdated, though it can still be useful. Because it was collected through a third party and the respondants only total to 30, it is not extremely reliable data, but I will still perform analysis.

## Process
### ***Check the data for errors***

### ***Choose your tools***
The tools that I chose to use during this case study included **MySQL Workbench, Excel, and Tableau.** SQL for easy analysis and Tableau for visualizations of my findings.

### ***Transform the data so you can work with it effectively***

### ***Document the cleaning process***
